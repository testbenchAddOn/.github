### TestBench JADE–AddOn Proposal

### Hi there 👋

- 🙋‍♀️ **Introduction** -  TestBench-AddOn  is a JADE agent with an integrated development microenvironment, designed to create agents, check their responses, and add or modify their parameters and classes while they remain deployed and running on the platform.

- 🌈 **Contribution guidelines** -  Well, how to say it, testBench is a JADE-AddOn in the proposal phase to the JADE Team. If it passes that phase, and is approved, then it will be subject to the GNU–LGPLv2.1 license. </br>
If all goes well, then it will be in the JADE-AddOns Trunk. This Github Organization will help us, during these months of evaluation, to locate the cloning point of the plugin. Thanks a lot :octocat: for that.


> [!NOTE]
> Version 1.1, September 5, 2024<br>
Estimated release date, September 21, 2024.

See you soon,<br>
